# Usage Responsibility
I take absolutely no responsibility whatsoever, it is up to you whether you use it or not.

# Using
When you run loadstring code, press ```F``` and it will run, press ```F``` again and the flight code will stop.
```lua
loadstring(game:HttpGet("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Entitynt/Roblox-Fly-Script/refs/heads/main/FlyCommand.lua",true))()
```

# Code Explain
An extremely simple code allows **LocalPlayer HumanoidRootPart** to command fly by controlling velocity **X,Y,Z** and can work in major games like Jailbreak, Arsenal, Dahood & Blox Fruits but **can be detected** by some Anti-Cheats!
